## MANDATORY FIRST STEP - Load Schema Context

**BEFORE any analysis begins, you MUST:**

1. **Load schema.yml from GitHub using GitHub MCP tool:**
   ```
   Tool: user-github-get_file_contents
   Parameters:
     owner: "nimrodfisher"
     repo: "workshop-queries-repo"
     path: "schema.yml"
   ```

2. **This provides essential business context:**
   - Table definitions and column meanings
   - Standard metric calculations (MRR, Churn, ARPU, etc.)
   - Pre-built query patterns for common questions
   - Table relationships and join patterns
   - SQL formatting standards

3. **Reference schema throughout analysis:**
   - Use `common_metrics` for metric definitions
   - Use `models` for table/column descriptions
   - Use `relationships` for joins
   - Use `common_business_questions` for query patterns
   - Use `sql_style_guide` for formatting

**See SCHEMA_LOADING_EXAMPLE.md for detailed usage guide.**

## Analysis Instructions

After loading schema.yml:
- Follow instructions from agent_instructions.md file
- Pull data directly from Supabase MCP
- When printing queries, follow standards in SQL_OUTPUT_STANDARDS.md
- Use schema.yml context for all business logic and metric calculations

## Conversational Analysis Mode (Default)

**The analysis will pause at key checkpoints to:**
- Explain what was done
- Share key findings
- Request permission to proceed

**To run without pauses**, say: "run the full analysis" or "skip confirmations"

**Checkpoints:**
1. After first SQL query execution
2. After EDA completion
3. Before generating reports

See `conversational_workflow.mdc` for complete details.
