## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Strong Overall MRR Growth Despite Plan-Level Variations

**Insight:** Total MRR increased by 29.5% over 12 months, from $7,202 in January 2025 to $9,322 in December 2025, demonstrating healthy business growth.

**Evidence:** 
- Starting MRR: $7,202 (January 2025)
- Ending MRR: $9,322 (December 2025)
- Peak MRR: $9,401 (May 2025)
- Average monthly MRR: $8,850

**Business Impact:** This represents approximately $2,120 in additional monthly recurring revenue, translating to roughly $25,440 in annual recurring revenue growth. The growth trajectory indicates strong product-market fit and customer retention.

### Finding 2: Pro Plan Shows Highest Growth Rate

**Insight:** The Pro plan demonstrated the strongest growth trajectory (+52.1%), growing from $2,053 to $3,123, despite starting from the lowest MRR base.

**Evidence:**
- January 2025: $2,053 (lowest among all plans)
- December 2025: $3,123 (second highest)
- Growth rate: +52.1% (highest among all plans)
- Key growth period: February-March 2025 (+20.80% and +20.40% MoM)

**Business Impact:** The Pro plan's strong growth suggests it may be the "sweet spot" for customer acquisition, offering the right balance of features and pricing. This could indicate an opportunity to further optimize the Pro plan positioning or invest more in Pro plan marketing.

---

### Finding 3: Enterprise Plan Exhibits High Volatility

**Insight:** The Enterprise plan showed the most volatility, with significant month-over-month swings, including the largest single-month growth (+26.45% in March) and notable declines (-8.18% in May, -5.85% in April).

**Evidence:**
- Volatility range: -8.18% to +26.45% MoM changes
- Peak MRR: $3,609 (March 2025)
- Current MRR: $3,041 (December 2025)
- Total growth: +30.7% over 12 months

**Business Impact:** The volatility suggests Enterprise customers may have longer sales cycles, seasonal buying patterns, or be more sensitive to economic conditions. This requires closer monitoring and potentially more sophisticated forecasting models for Enterprise revenue.

---

### Finding 4: Complete Stability Since June 2025

**Insight:** All three plans have shown zero month-over-month change from June 2025 through December 2025, indicating a period of stability or potential stagnation.

**Evidence:**
- Free plan: Stable at $3,158 (7 months)
- Pro plan: Stable at $3,123 (7 months)
- Enterprise plan: Stable at $3,041 (7 months)
- Total MRR: Stable at $9,322 (7 months)

**Business Impact:** While stability can indicate healthy retention, the lack of growth for 7 consecutive months may signal a need for new customer acquisition initiatives, upselling campaigns, or product enhancements to drive expansion revenue.
