## Executive Summary

Our Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) has grown dramatically from $8,064 in June 2024 to $111,864 in December 2025—a 1,287% increase over 19 months. However, this impressive growth has plateaued since March 2025, with ARR declining 5% from its peak and remaining flat for the past six months. All three plan tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise) now contribute roughly equally to revenue (~$37K each), indicating good diversification but also revealing that Enterprise customers have churned at a higher rate than other tiers. The business has successfully scaled from 8 subscriptions to 88, but growth has stalled and requires immediate attention.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Explosive Growth Followed by Plateau

**Insight:** ARR grew 1,387% in the first 6 months (June-December 2024), continued growing through March 2025 to peak at $117,336, but has since declined 5% and remained flat for 6 months.

**Evidence:** 
- June 2024: $8,064 ARR across 8 subscriptions
- December 2024: $77,764 ARR across 63 subscriptions (+865% growth)
- March 2025: $117,336 ARR across 92 subscriptions (PEAK)
- December 2025: $111,864 ARR across 88 subscriptions (-4.7% from peak)

**Business Impact:** While historical growth was exceptional, the current 6-month stagnation suggests the business has hit a growth ceiling. The flat ARR indicates new subscriptions are only replacing canceled ones, not driving net growth. This requires immediate strategic intervention to reignite growth momentum.

### Finding 2: Balanced Revenue Distribution Across Plans

**Insight:** Revenue is remarkably balanced across all three plan tiers, with each contributing approximately one-third of total ARR.

**Evidence:**
- Free plan: $37,896 (33.9% of total ARR) - 32 active subscriptions
- Pro plan: $37,476 (33.5% of total ARR) - 27 active subscriptions  
- Enterprise plan: $36,492 (32.6% of total ARR) - 29 active subscriptions

**Business Impact:** Excellent revenue diversification reduces risk of over-reliance on any single customer segment. However, the balance also suggests Free plan may be underpriced or Enterprise may be overpriced/under-valued, as typically higher tiers should contribute disproportionately more revenue per subscription.

---

### Finding 3: Enterprise Tier Shows Concerning Volatility

**Insight:** The Enterprise plan experienced the highest peak ($43,308 in March 2025) but also the largest decline, dropping 16% to $36,492 by June 2025 and remaining stagnant since.

**Evidence:**
- March 2025: Enterprise ARR peaked at $43,308 (31 subscriptions)
- June 2025: Enterprise ARR declined to $36,492 (29 subscriptions, -16%)
- Net loss: $6,816 in Enterprise ARR over 3 months
- Current state: Flat at $36,492 for past 6 months

**Business Impact:** High-value Enterprise customers are churning or downgrading, representing significant lost revenue opportunity. At $1,258 average monthly price per Enterprise subscription, losing just 2-3 Enterprise accounts represents $30K-$45K in lost ARR annually. This tier requires immediate attention for retention and expansion.

---

### Finding 4: All Plans Experienced Simultaneous Decline in April 2025

**Insight:** April 2025 marked the first month where all three plan tiers experienced simultaneous ARR decline, suggesting a systematic issue rather than plan-specific problems.

**Evidence:**
- Enterprise: -5.8% MoM in April 2025
- Free: -9.0% MoM in April 2025
- Pro: -2.6% MoM in April 2025
- Combined effect: -7.5% total ARR decline in single month

**Business Impact:** The synchronized decline across all tiers points to an external factor (market conditions, competitive pressure, product issue, pricing change, or service disruption) rather than segment-specific challenges. Investigating what changed in April 2025 should be a top priority.

---

### Finding 5: Free Plan Shows Strongest Relative Growth

**Insight:** The Free plan grew 2,205% from its June 2024 baseline, significantly outpacing Pro (917%) and Enterprise (1,234%), and is now the largest revenue contributor by tier.

**Evidence:**
- Free plan growth: $1,644 → $37,896 (+2,205%)
- Pro plan growth: $3,684 → $37,476 (+917%)
- Enterprise plan growth: $2,736 → $36,492 (+1,234%)
- Free plan now has the most active subscriptions (32 vs 27-29 for other tiers)

**Business Impact:** While Free tier growth is positive, it may indicate challenges in upselling to higher-value tiers or suggest the product-market fit is strongest at the lower price point. This could limit long-term revenue expansion if customers aren't upgrading. However, it also represents a healthy pipeline for potential upsell opportunities.

---

### Long-term / Strategic

1. **Build Net Revenue Retention (NRR) Tracking**
   - Owner: Finance/Analytics Team
   - Action: Implement cohort-based NRR analysis to track expansion, contraction, churn
   - Expected Impact: Better visibility into revenue health, identify expansion opportunities

2. **Diversify Revenue Through Enterprise Expansion**
   - Owner: Sales Team
   - Action: Focus on adding new Enterprise customers and expanding existing accounts
   - Expected Impact: If successful, could grow ARR by 30-50% ($35K-$55K additional ARR)

   - Action: Understand why Enterprise tier is volatile—does the product deliver enough value at this price?
   - Expected Impact: Improved retention, potential to double Enterprise ARR to $70K+

---

## Limitations & Caveats

- **Data Limitation:** Analysis is based on subscription start/cancel dates, not actual payment/invoice data. Unpaid invoices or payment failures are not reflected in ARR calculations.
- **Assumption:** Trialing subscriptions (10 currently) are included in ARR projections. If these trials don't convert, current ARR could be overstated by ~$11K.
- **Scope:** Analysis covers June 2024 - December 2025. Pre-June 2024 trends are not available for comparison.
- **Future Projections:** The 6-month plateau suggests ARR will remain flat at ~$112K through Q1 2026 unless interventions are successful.
