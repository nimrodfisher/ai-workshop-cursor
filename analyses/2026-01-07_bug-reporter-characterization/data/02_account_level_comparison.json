  "business_implications": [
    "Bug reporting is strongly correlated with HIGH ENGAGEMENT - active users find more issues",
    "Larger teams (more users) lead to more bug reports - more eyes on the product",
    "MarTech and HealthTech industries may have more complex use cases that surface bugs",
    "FinTech accounts show NO bug reports despite 20% representation - potentially different usage patterns or higher tolerance",
    "Newer accounts (newer customers) are more likely to report bugs - possibly in onboarding/learning phase"
