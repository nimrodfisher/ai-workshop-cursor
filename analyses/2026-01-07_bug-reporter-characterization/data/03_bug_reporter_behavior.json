    "Bug reports happen VERY QUICKLY after signup: median 6 days, avg 14 days",
    "Most bug reporters (95.24%) only open ONE bug ticket - not repeat reporters",
    "LIMITED data overlap: 17 out of 21 bug reporters have no events in 7-day window around bug report",
    "Events data starts AFTER most bug tickets were filed, limiting temporal analysis",
    "Admin role dominates bug reporting: 52.38% of bug reporters",
    "Bug reporting appears to be tied to ONBOARDING phase (median 6 days)",
    "Very few users become 'serial bug reporters' (only 1 user with 2 tickets)"
  ],
  "business_implications": [
    "Bug reports cluster in the ONBOARDING/EARLY USAGE period (first 1-2 weeks)",
    "This suggests bugs are discovered during initial product exploration",
    "Most bugs are reported ONCE by users, not repeatedly",
    "Admin users report more bugs - possibly due to broader product access/usage",

  "data_quality_note": "The misalignment between bug ticket dates (Dec 2024-Jun 2025) and events dates (Mar 2025-Jun 2025) significantly limits our ability to analyze triggering events. Future analyses should ensure data coverage alignment."
