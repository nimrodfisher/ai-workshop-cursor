    "Bug reporting rate is U-SHAPED: high at extremes (no subscription & high MRR), low in middle (low MRR)",
    "Enterprise accounts WITHOUT subscriptions report bugs at 80% rate - highest of all segments",
    "Within High MRR: Pro plans report MORE bugs (66.67%) than Enterprise (25.00%)",

    "surprising_patterns": [
      "Accounts with NO subscription report MORE bugs than paying low-value customers",

  "business_implications": [
    "NO SUBSCRIPTION accounts (likely trials/evaluation) are highly engaged and report many bugs",
    "This suggests TRIAL USERS are actively testing the product and finding issues",
    "Low MRR customers may be less engaged or using fewer features (less bug exposure)",
    "High-value customers report bugs at moderate rates - engaged but perhaps more tolerant",
    "Bug reports from NO SUBSCRIPTION accounts are CRITICAL - these are potential high-value customers evaluating",
    "The 80% bug rate for Enterprise no-subscription suggests evaluation/trial phase needs attention",
    "Low MRR segment's low bug rate (16.67%) suggests either: limited usage, high tolerance, or feature limitations"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "PRIORITIZE bug fixes for trial/evaluation users (no subscription) - they're actively evaluating and finding issues",
    "Focus on improving trial experience - 80% of enterprise trials report bugs",
    "Investigate why low MRR customers report fewer bugs - are they less engaged?",
    "Consider that bug reporting is a sign of ENGAGEMENT, not necessarily dissatisfaction",
    "Use bug reports from trial users as early warning signals for onboarding friction"
